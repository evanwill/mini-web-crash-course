# What is GitHub?

[GitHub](https://github.com/){:target="_blank"} is a cloud [Git](https://git-scm.com/){:target="_blank"} repository hosting service with builtin features for collaboration and project management, sort of like Google Drive for code.

Originally designed to manage large open-source software projects, its use has expanded to many other types of organizations and individuals, with over 30 million users.
It is the most popular platform for developing and sharing code from enterprise projects, to hands-on learning, to academic projects.
Thus, it is helpful to get familiar with the web interface so that you can take part in this community.

For this workshop, GitHub provides a handy, free platform for creating plain text files and serving them on the live web!

## What is GitHub Pages

One amazingly useful GitHub feature is [GitHub Pages](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/){:target='_blank'}.
It provides free static web hosting from any repository.
GH-Pages is intended to host relatively simple sites for your GitHub portfolio, project, or documentation.
Because it is free and a valuable transferable skill, this is a great option for teaching and learning.

Many organizations are using GitHub to collaboratively create and publish public workshop websites. 
For example: 

- [Programming Historian](http://programminghistorian.org/)
- this site!
