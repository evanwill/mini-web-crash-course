# Workshop Prep

Please create a free [GitHub account](https://github.com/join) if you do not have one already.
We will use the built in web editor to create files on GitHub.

## Optional Stuff

To do more with GitHub, you might want a deeper introduction, check out: 

- GitHub's [Hello World guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)
- GitHub Learning Lab: [Introduction to GitHub](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github) and [GitHub Pages](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/github-pages)

When working with code you need a good text editor.
All code is [plain text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_text). 
Word processors do not handle plain text with out altering it.
Windows notepad does not handle UTF-8 encoding or UNIX line endings that are standard for cross platform applications. 
For basic editing, Windows [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/), Mac TextEdit, or Linux Gedit are sufficient.
However, a more complete code editor will be helpful for larger projects.

Open-source cross platform text editor suggestions:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Atom](https://atom.io/)
